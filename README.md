# E-Commerce-Dashboard-using-MERN-Full-Stack

Developed a dynamic e-commerce dashboard using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), incorporating JWT for secure user authentication and CORS for managing cross-origin resource sharing. The platform enables user registration and login, and provides authenticated users with functionalities to search, add, update, and delete products. Featuring an intuitive interface and a robust backend, the dashboard ensures efficient data management and seamless user interactions, highlighting my expertise in full-stack development, secure API integration, and user-centric design.
